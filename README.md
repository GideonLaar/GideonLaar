### Hi, I'm Gideon 🌟

I'm an enthusiast for home 🏠 and organizational automations. I primarily work with C#, Linux, and MacOS and love deploying to Azure ⛅️.

I currently work at [Justspark](https://werkenbij.justspark.com/gideon-werkt-bij-justspark/) as the lead of the research and development department 🕵️. I love spending my time creating cool automations that make my life easier (and lazier). I'd rather tweak my coffee machine to make the perfect cappuccino from my desk than go to the kitchen and prepare it by hand.

- 💙 C#, .NET, PowerShell, Azure, React, Flutter
- 😻 I love AI (and currently learning more about it, you can already find me on [HuggingFace🤗](https://huggingface.co/C00100011)
- 💚 Tech, Gaming, Wearables, Food, Traveling
- 🫰 Have you figured out what my username is about? Love to create a mystery.

Hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gwjvdlaar/), [HuggingFace🤗](https://huggingface.co/C00100011), [My blog](https://c00100011.dev/) or on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@c00100011_gideon) (not a Twitter(X) fan).
